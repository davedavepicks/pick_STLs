# DaveDavePicks Original pick designs as downloadable STL files

A public, opensource set of original DaveDavePicks guitar pick 3-D files.

Welcome! I have been designing and making guitar picks for over 5 years, and using 3-D printing techniques for over 3 years. Some examples of my output can be found on [davedavepicks.com](https://www.davedavepicks.com) and for sale on my [Heavy Repping! Store](https://heavyrepping.com/davedavepicks/). The time and money that goes into this endevour mostly involves the design (on paper, through making and prototyping and/or in 3-D modelling software) followed by the printing, the raw materials, and the finishing (the hours and hours of sanding and polishing to make them the beautifaul yet functional things they are).

I have decided to opensource my designs.

What this means:

- I will not be stopping making picks;
- I will continue to make models added here and others (such as custom designs I won't be including here);
- the vast majority of people do not have the equipment to produce these picks, but for those who do, I'm happy to supply these files free of charge;
- anyone can download, edit and 3-D print these designs as long as they attribute the designs to me, with this as the source;
- they can sell their prints of my designs as-is, and/or their adaptations, but must also share their designs with the same license (details below and in [LICENSE](LICENSE) file).

I am also happy to take contributions, issues, etc., if anyone would like to contributed a new design or modify an existing design, or suggest a change to an existing design for me to make (tip too sharp/rounded, grip to flat/textured, thumb pick or finger pick size not quite right, etc.).
