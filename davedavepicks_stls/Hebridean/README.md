# Hebridean

## hebridean_outer.stl and hebridean_inner.stl

Based on an original DaveDavePicks design of a *bound* plectrum (mimicking the binding on a guitar) and named after the Scottish Hebridean Isles in an Instagram competition. Constructed from two parts of, e.g., differently coloured 3d-printing resin. Features a DDP logo and a silhouette of the Outer Hebrides - part of the Scottish Western Isles.
